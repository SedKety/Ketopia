  - Some more important things to know about this world is that it consists of chunks,
  - These chunks once where an biome back on Old ketopia, Cuddles probably has told
    you this already so ill stop yapping
  - Anyways, these chunks have different materials so you'll have to gather specific
    resources in specific biomes,
  - You will need to craft yourself some handy gear to destroy certain items such
    as stronger rocks, bigger trees or stronger ores.
  - If you are lucky  you might stumble across an "mysterious" island, they hold
    information about the old world, and might hold good materials and treasures,
  - Anyways, return to me upon Needing information about the current ship!!
